# üß† Welcome to MoodMate!

Hey there! Welcome to MoodMate, a little Java app we built to help people (like us!) get better at building habits, keeping an eye on their mood, and getting a bit of smart, personalized feedback along the way. We designed this whole thing with a big focus on solid Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## ‚ú® What Can It Do?

MoodMate is packed with features for both everyday users and the admin running the show.

#### For You (The User)

* **Log In & Sign Up:** A secure and simple way to keep your personal progress private.
* **Track Your Habits:** Add, view, and check off your daily habits.
* **Get Motivated by Streaks:** We automatically track your consecutive day streaks and cheer you on when you hit milestones like 3, 7, 14, or even 30 days!
* **Log Your Mood:** Quickly jot down how you're feeling (Happy, Sad, Tired, etc.) and add any notes about your day.
* **Get Smart Suggestions:** Our simple "AI" looks for keywords in your notes and offers up a thoughtful suggestion.
* **Daily Dose of Inspiration:** Get a random quote tailored to your mood to give you a little boost.

#### For the Admin

* **See the Big Picture:** Check out a full list of all registered users and see who's an admin.
* **Check the Stats:** Get a quick look at how the app is being used, like the total number of users, habits, and moods logged.
* **Be the Inspirer:** Add new quotes to the app's collection.
* **Share the Power:** Promote a regular user to an Admin.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It's Built

We built this project from the ground up using core OOP ideas to keep our code clean, flexible, and easy to build upon.

* **Inheritance & Abstraction:** We started with an `abstract Person` class as a blueprint. Both `User` and `Admin` classes inherit from it, which means they share common traits but have their own unique menus and abilities.
* **Polymorphism:** We use a single `Person currentUser` variable to handle whoever is logged in. At runtime, we use `instanceof` to check if it's a `User` or an `Admin` and show the right set of options. It's like having one remote that can control two different devices.
* **Encapsulation:** We've kept our data safe! All the important variables in our classes are `private` or `protected`. The only way to interact with them is through `public` methods, which acts as a protective barrier.
* **Composition:** Our `User` class is built like a Lego set. It's "composed" of other objects, holding `ArrayLists` of `Habit` and `MoodLog` objects to keep all of a user's data neatly organized.

#### The Core Classes

* **`Person`**: The abstract blueprint for anyone in the system.
* **`User`**: You! This class holds your personal lists of habits and moods.
* **`Admin`**: The superuser with special privileges.
* **`Habit`**: The brains behind each habit, including all the logic for calculating streaks.
* **`MoodLog`**: A simple class to store your mood and notes for a given day.
* **`MoodAnalyzer`**: Our rule-based "AI" that scans your notes for keywords.
* **`QuoteManager`**: The little engine that loads and serves up daily quotes.
* **`DataManager`**: The unsung hero that saves and loads all your data so you never lose progress.

## üöÄ Getting Started

#### What You'll Need

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher.
* A cool IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.

#### Let's Get it Running

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Adarsh0248/MoodMate-Java-Project.git](https://github.com/Adarsh0248/MoodMate-Java-Project.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the project** in your IDE.
3.  **Find the main file** at `src/com/moodmate/main/ModeMateApp.java`.
4.  **Hit the run button** on the `main()` method to start the app!

#### First-Time Login

* When you first launch the app, we've already created one default admin account for you to play with.
* **Email:** `admin@moodmate.com`
* **Password:** `admin123`

## üíª Tech We Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Core Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, IntelliJ IDEA
* **Libraries:** JUnit 5 (for testing)
